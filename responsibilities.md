# DSA Accountability Statement on Responsibilities of Accessible Communications

## Accountability

Administrators who are, for whatever reason, in dereliction of their responsibilties around facilitating access (as outlined in this document) **must** be subject to democratic recall.

## Discoverability

The operators of any venue of communication are responsible for communicating to the general membership:

- that their venue exists,
- how to access it,
- who moderates it,
- and what the process for choosing what gets posted on it and what doesn't is (where applicable).

## Usability

Forums for member participation must be intuitive and easy to understand to the average member. (Detailing mechanisms for objectively gauging intuition and ease of use on average are outside the scope of this document.)

## ARIA Compliance et al

*This space reserved for the suggestions of the Disability Task Force*

## Maintenance

Each project MUST have a bus factor of at least 3 - that is to say, the site / component must be able to continue to function in the event that *any two specific members are removed from its operation*.

## Contextualization

In non-interactive communications (such as newsletters), hyperlinks to context need to be provided wherever possible. If an announcement is based on a decision made in discussion on Rocket Chat, a link to that discussion **must** be provided. **Every** conversation on something that was posted publically (to the general membership) needs to include a link to the post in question.

On forums interactive to the general membership, contextualization is the responsibility of *all* participants (with moderators expected to lead by example). Each member should strive to provide context to any potential newcomers or future discoverers of the conversation whenever possible. If there's a conversation on Discourse about something that was said on Rocket Chat, you should post a link to that discussion, and vice versa.
