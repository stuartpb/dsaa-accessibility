# DSA Accountability Statement on Responsibilities of Accessible Communications

## Accountability

Administrators who are, for whatever reason, in dereliction of their responsibilties around facilitating access (as outlined in this document) **must** be subject to democratic recall.

## Discoverability

The operators of any venue of communication are responsible for communicating to the general membership:

- that their venue exists,
- how to access it,
- who moderates it,
- and what the process for choosing what gets posted on it and what doesn't is (where applicable).

## Usability

Forums for member participation must be intuitive and easy to understand to the average member. (Detailing mechanisms for objectively gauging intuition and ease of use on average are outside the scope of this document.)

## Documentation

In places where solutions may not be immediately intuitive, documentation should be reaily avaiable, with clear communication as to where and how the documentation should be consulted for an understanding of common tasks: for example, it's not adequate to tell a member looking for help in submitting a document for broadcast that they need to pore through the entirety of a two-hundred-page manual, or even a *twenty* page manual (if the whole of that manual isn't primarily dedicated to answering their question). Our members, who are usually volunteers working in the time spared from their day jobs, shouldn't be expected to shoulder the burden of finding answers where a more knowledgeable expert could provide an answer more quickly. Documentation should aim to take no more than ten minutes to convey how to accomplish any specific task.

## Maintenance

Operators of communication channels are responsible

At a minimum, communications should have a [bus factor][] of at least 3 - that is to say, the site / component must be able to continue to function in the event that *any two specific members are removed from its operation*.

## Contextualization

In non-interactive communications (such as newsletters), hyperlinks to context need to be provided wherever possible. If an announcement is based on a decision made in discussion on Rocket Chat, a link to that discussion **must** be provided. **Every** conversation on something that was posted publically (to the general membership) needs to include a link to the post in question.

On forums interactive to the general membership, contextualization is the responsibility of *all* participants (with moderators expected to lead by example). Each member should strive to provide context to any potential newcomers or future discoverers of the conversation whenever possible. If there's a conversation on Discourse about something that was said on Rocket Chat, you should post a link to that discussion, and vice versa.
