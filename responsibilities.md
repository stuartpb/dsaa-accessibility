# DSA Accountability Statement on Responsibilities of Accessible Communications

## Accountability

Administrators who are, for whatever reason, in dereliction of their responsibilties around facilitating access (as outlined in this document) **must** be subject to democratic recall.

## Discoverability

The operators of any venue of communication are responsible for communicating to the general membership:

- that their venue exists,
- how to access it,
- who moderates it,
- and what the process for choosing what gets posted on it and what doesn't is (where applicable).

## Control of Implementation and Access

Primary business communiques (including event announcements) should be restricted to channels and forums that are controlled, at the highest levels possible, by the DSA. Proprietary and corporate-controlled venues, such as Facebook and Twitter, should not be used to conduct or communicate any official matters, except as rebroadcasts of material originally published through systems under the DSA's purview.

This prevents communications being denied to members who refuse to engage with these machines of corporate control, and/or members that have been *denied* access to these sites (such as [those who have been banned from Twitter for antagonizing the accounts of people in power][Twitter bans]).

This also prevents outside interference with official communications, such as "algorithm tweaks" that may silence communications (as Facebook is known for doing to encourage monetized "promotions" of posts), or changes to critical features the organization has been relying upon without adequate notice or feedback (such as when [Twitter cancelled third-party clients' access to their API][Twitter API], or Facebook [removed Group capabilities from open-membership Groups by converting them to "Pages"][Groups to Pages]).

The extent that presence is extended to outside venues like Facebook should follow [Richard Stallman's guidelines for organizational presence on Facebook][rms-fbp].

## Usability

Forums for member participation must be intuitive and easy to understand to the average member. (Detailing mechanisms for objectively gauging intuition and ease of use on average are outside the scope of this document.)

## Documentation

In places where solutions may not be immediately intuitive, documentation should be reaily avaiable, with clear communication as to where and how the documentation should be consulted for an understanding of common tasks: for example, it's not adequate to tell a member looking for help in submitting a document for broadcast that they need to pore through the entirety of a two-hundred-page manual, or even a *twenty* page manual (if the whole of that manual isn't primarily dedicated to answering their question). Our members, who are usually volunteers working in the time spared from their day jobs, shouldn't be expected to shoulder the burden of finding answers where a more knowledgeable expert could provide an answer more quickly. Documentation should aim to take no more than ten minutes to convey how to accomplish any specific task.

## Ease of Access for the Differently-Abled

Communications should never be presented in formats that unnecessarily make access more difficult for members with disabilities. For instance, if an announcement is distributed as part of a podcast, that announcement should be provided as a script or transcription, which makes it so access to its content is not a barrier for the hearing impaired.

For interactive web applications, the work of the [World Wide Web Consortium Web Accessibility Initative][WAI] should be consulted to ensure adequate accessibility.

## Maintenance

Operators of communication channels are responsible

At a minimum, communications should have a [bus factor][] of at least 3 - that is to say, the site / component must be able to continue to function in the event that *any two specific members are removed from its operation*.

## Contextualization

In non-interactive communications (such as newsletters), hyperlinks to context need to be provided wherever possible. If an announcement is based on a decision made in discussion on Rocket Chat, a link to that discussion **must** be provided. **Every** conversation on something that was posted publically (to the general membership) needs to include a link to the post in question.

On forums interactive to the general membership, contextualization is the responsibility of *all* participants (with moderators expected to lead by example). Each member should strive to provide context to any potential newcomers or future discoverers of the conversation whenever possible. If there's a conversation on Discourse about something that was said on Rocket Chat, you should post a link to that discussion, and vice versa.
