This repository consists of three files:

- statement.md, A statement on what we're (generally) asking for and why we're asking for it

- responsibilities.md, A document describing exactly the criteria that would be pass/fail for whatever the NPC settles on

- reccomendations.md, A document with what I'd recommend to pass all the aforementioned criteria
