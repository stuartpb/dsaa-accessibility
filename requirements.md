IN THIS DOCUMENT: TODO: concrete, pass-or-fail, evaluatable explanation of what criteria DSA media needs to satisfy to be satisfactory to the DSA Accountability Task Force

I'll probably do this in the form of RFC MUST/SHOULD/MAY in the final draft, this is all just really loose in this initial commit

Each of these forums needs to be readily accessible to any new member who joins their DSA local interested in their output.

They need to be easy to use...

Hyperlinks to context need to be provided wherever possible. If there's a conversation on Discourse about something that was said on Rocket Chat, it needs to be linked in, and vice versa. **Every** conversation on something that was posted publically needs to include a link to the post in question.

## Maintenance

Each project MUST have a bus factor of at least 3 - that is to say, the site / component must be able to continue to function in the event that *any two specific members are removed from its operation*.

Administrators MUST be subject to democratic recall in the event that they are found to be in dereliction of their duties in facilitating access.
