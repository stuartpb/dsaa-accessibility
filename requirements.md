IN THIS DOCUMENT: TODO: concrete, pass-or-fail, evaluatable explanation of what criteria DSA media needs to satisfy to be satisfactory to the DSA Accountability Task Force

I'll probably do this in the form of RFC MUST/SHOULD/MAY in the final draft, this is all just really loose in this initial commit

> io: iâ€™d say it at least starts with the general membership knowing it exists, how to get on it, who moderates it, and a clear process for choosing what gets posted on it and what doesnt

## Announcements & Publications

These are requirements for any publications

### Contextualization

Hyperlinks to context need to be provided wherever possible. If an announcement is based on a decision made in discussion on Rocket Chat, a link to that discussion **must** be provided. **Every** conversation on something that was posted publically (to the general membership) needs to include a link to the post in question.

## Interactive Forums of Discussion

Each of these forums needs to be readily accessible to any new member who joins their DSA local interested in their output.

They need to be easy to use...

### Maintenance

Each project MUST have a bus factor of at least 3 - that is to say, the site / component must be able to continue to function in the event that *any two specific members are removed from its operation*.

Administrators MUST be subject to democratic recall in the event that they are found to be in dereliction of their duties in facilitating access.

### Contextualization

On forums interactive to the general membership, contextualization is the responsibility of *all* participants. Each member should strive to provide context to any potential newcomers or future discoverers of the conversation whenever possible. If there's a conversation on Discourse about something that was said on Rocket Chat, you should post a link to that discussion, and vice versa.
