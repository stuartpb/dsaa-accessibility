# DSA Accountability Statement on Accessible Communications

> "But, Mr Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine months."
>
> "Oh yes, well, as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn't exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them, had you? I mean, like actually telling anybody or anything."
>
> "But the plans were on display..."
>
> "On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them."
>
> "That's the display department."
>
> "With a flashlight."
>
> "Ah, well, the lights had probably gone."
>
> "So had the stairs."
>
> "But look, you found the notice, didn't you?"
>
> "Yes," said Arthur, "yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the Leopard.'"

Right now, official DSA communiques are spread across a variety of forums, each with their own barriers to entry and use. To give an inexhaustive list:

- Facebook, in the "New Members" group and in various group messages
- The DSA RocketChat
- The "activist" listserv
- Various Twitter accounts

There are three classes of DSA Forum that ought to exist:

One: there should be a place for official announcements where it's easy enough to post, but clear that they're, you know, Conclusive, it's not just discussion.

Two: A place for open-ended discussion, pre-conclusion. Debate, raising new ideas, all that.

Three: Twitter et al, public spaces.

In short: Announcements, Discussion, and Advertising (Being Extremely Cool and Online).

## On Power

The web - for all its faults - still holds an *enormous* potential. Imagine trying to hold a cross-country meeting of members from all different chapters pursuing tasks of Accountability by _phone_. Or by _mail_. Or by _actually having them travel out in person_. Even *email* is limited and painful, by comparison to the kinds of rich and complex interactions you can wring from the greater web.

Only through the web do we have the means to send somebody, anywhere, at virtually no cost, a link that can show them anything we need them to see, and anything even _tangentially_ related - and it's these tangents where the most fertile innovation is born.

I can tell someone that something is "like Chesterton's Fence", they can highlight it, right-click "Search Google For 'Chesterton's Fence'", and immediately learn what it is, without placing _any burden on me_. I don't have to take ten minutes to explain it, or go to my library and pick a book off the shelf, or direct them to the famous academic who can give them the best lecture about its details after consulting their schedule in the Town Square.

Point is, through new technology, **the primordia of revolution has fundamentally changed**. Like the printing press before it, one person can suddenly teach a million. But now, they can do it _with no expenditure of capital_. _Anybody_ can do this, and can direct others within it, _infinitely_.

TODO: explain importance of accessibility in unlocking this power at scale, and how bad accessibility can and will nip the revolution in the bud

TODO: bring it all home by explaining how proper Accessibility is the forerunner of Accountability
